## GAMEPLAY
The main objective is to direct the snake towards the food (small green item).
The more food the snake eats the more it grows.
The game follows the same old rules.
- To move use the up, down, right and left direction keys.
- The snake cannot turn to the opposite of the direction its facing.
- _You cannot go past walls (Not particularly an old rule but may change)_
- Try avoiding biting yourself otherwise it's game over for you.
